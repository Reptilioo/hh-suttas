  "mn37:3.5": "There is a double meaning to the expression _sabbaṃ dhammaṃ (abhijānāti)_, which has been rendered as either “all things” or as “everything”, even though it's clearly singular unlike the _sabbe dhammā_ just above. The phrase can point simultaneously to how this statement is the essence of the Buddha's teaching, and also to the phenomenon (_dhammaṃ_) of “the All” (_sabbaṃ_) described in other Suttas (SN 35.23, SN 35.80). Not discerning the full extent of experience—a state maintained chiefly by a lack of development of sense restraint—automatically entails being moved by feelings and trying to manipulate them. Note that “knowing the full extent of experience” is not about some finding some hidden secret, but about ceasing to ignore things that are already there. A prime example of it would be not overlooking the [intention behind one’s actions](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/intentions-behind-ones-actions/)—not trying to expand one’s awareness of inconsequential perceptions like sounds and bodily sensations.
