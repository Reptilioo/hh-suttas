  "mn53:0.2": "This Sutta is directed at noble disciples—those who are _sotāpannas_ or above. But the principle does apply even before that point: these are the necessary factors one needs to have in order to *progress* in the practice, whether it’s towards stream-entry or towards Arahantship, and whether  a layperson or a monastic. From the Suttas it can be inferred that many laypeople would have kept only the five precepts after attaining the Right View, and this means that from that point onwards, lacking the factors listed in this Sutta, they were no longer “practicing trainees” (_sekho pāṭipado_)—they had largely suspended their efforts to progress further for the time being, postponing also their practice of  jhānas. They can only stand atop the whole structure of the Gradual Training mentioned here too, whose very purpose is to gradually withdraw the mind from the five hindrances (which also happen to be what prevents noble understanding from arising: AN 5.51). See [Stream Entry For Laypeople](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2AWxZnxeYk) and the impediments to progress listed in [MN 16](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn16). ",
