  "mn54:4.12": "These injunctions echo the ones in [MN 8](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn8). The point is that one shouldn’t expect something else apart from one’s own volition to make or help one abstain from bad actions. Often there is the idea that virtue and good behavior should come as a result of meditation rather than the other way around, and that’s often rooted in the expectation that restraint should be easy. But the development of mind that matters lies precisely in no longer being bothered by displeasure and difficulties, not in ceasing to have them. ",
