  "mn27:15.7": "I translate _mano_ as “mind-sense” so as to not create confusion with _citta_, which is fundamentally a different thing. See for instance AN 6.55: the _mano_ of an Arahant can be assailed by oppressive phenomena, but their _citta_ would always remain unmoved. _mano_ is said to be Māra's property, while the _citta_ can be trained to no longer fall under his control (SN 35.246)."
