  "mn134:0.2": "The core message in this discourse is widely known but often misinterpreted. It’s not saying that one must stop intending in relation the past or the future \naltogether—which is a matter of choice only on the superficial, not fundamental level—but that one must stop *delighting* in such thoughts. ",
  "mn134:3.5": "",
  "mn134:3.6": "\n One sees thoughts about the past or future *as present phenomena* too. This automatically prevents one \nfrom delighting and getting pulled by them  if done properly. ",
  "mn134:4.5": "It’s not just *one way* of practice; it’s the template for every type of mental cultivation. In other words, one is never justified in trying to get rid of and replace presently arisen phenomena (beyond the foundational setup of virtue and sense restraint, which needs to be there from beforehand). ",
  "mn134:8-13.3": "The Pāli has a direct quote of the thought and says one does not delight *there*. Meaning, one does not prevent it from arising. ",
  "mn134:8-13.5": "This is ironically what’s happening behind the scenes whenever one attempts to suppress thoughts about the past or future, and “fabricate” more agreeable states in general. One unwittingly longs for a particular type of experience has not yet arisen, whereas the right cultivation is equanimity towards what is there *now*, as said in the verse. Obviously, there has to be a wholesome interest (_chanda_) in developing the mind, but that interest should drive one to abandon all longing (_abhijjhā_, the first hindrance), not to justify certain types of it. ",
  "mn134:8-13.9": "Similar to the above, it’s only because of still to some extent appropriating the five aggregates that one would seek to change their _content_, instead of cultivating the unfaltering recognition of the nature of whatever content is presently arisen. "
