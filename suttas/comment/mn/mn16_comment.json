  "mn16:13.1": " The first three obviously don’t imply that one needs to be a non-returner in order to make progress in the Dhamma, but that one certainly must have abandoned *actions* rooted in passion for sensuality, the body, and form. That is the only way to increase one’s capacity to understand the Dhamma (i.e., abandon the five hindrances, see AN 10.61 on what causes the hindrances). Those who already have a sufficient capacity (with “little dust in their eyes”) can understand it without a long period of developing restraint beforehand, like many householders of the Buddha’s time who attained stream-entry upon their first encounter with the teaching. For whomever it does not happen that way, there is “dust” that needs to be cleared up through the abandonment of passion for these three things, as it clearly indicates that one cannot presently understand the Four Noble Truths despite having more information about them than the average attained layperson in the Buddha's time probably did. See [“Stream Entry for Laypeople”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2AWxZnxeYk). ",

The Buddha always taught them chiefly for the sake of liberation, which is a spiritual ability too, and the only one that is guaranteed to come from developing these things. ",
