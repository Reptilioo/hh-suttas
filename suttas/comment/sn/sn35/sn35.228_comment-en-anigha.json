  "sn35.228:2.1": "Freedom\n from suffering is often conceived to be reached when things that incite\n suffering no longer arise for one. The Buddha's instructions not to \ntake things as “mine” and to “let go” are misused as strategies to \nsuppress and ameliorate feelings.<br><br> Instead, the \nright, imperturbable freedom is born of being ready to withstand \n*whatever* the six senses through at one, and this is the measure of \nhaving understood one’s entire experience, top to bottom, as not-self, \nas opposed to the common trap of using the idea of not-self as a coping \nmechanism. <br><br> It should be noted that one starts out not seeing the full extent of the “tide”, in the same sense as a _puthujjana_ doesn’t see suffering, the first noble truth. So, “withstanding the tide” requires developing understanding of what that entails first. One must fully comprehend how exactly one fails withstand the tide, [at which point one would be a *sotāpanna*](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn9#mn9:3.1-mn9:3.2). ",
  "sn35.228:2.2": "This same metaphor is used in several other Suttas with reference to the Arahant. "
