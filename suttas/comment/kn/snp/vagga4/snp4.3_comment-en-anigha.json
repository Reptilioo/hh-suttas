  "snp4.3:1.4": "“_khila_ is nearly always translated as ‘barrenness,’but at least in the Sutta Nipata, it is an alternative spelling of _khīla_ which in its literal meaning is a stake or post (see Snp 1.2) to which something is tied or by which something is demarcated. Sofiguratively, it means being ‘fixed’: sometimes ‘obstinate’like in [MN 16](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn16), or in a more subtle sense one could say ‘having astake in something.’  ‘Barrenness’ doesn’t fit for most contexts, see especially Snp. 1.12 where the sage is described as‘having cut down what has grown, not replanting’ (i.e. barrenness is actually what makes him a sage!) and later in the sameverse as _akhilaṁ._ ” ",
