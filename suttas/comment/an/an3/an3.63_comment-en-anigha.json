  "an3.63:0.3": "This Sutta disproves the widespread idea of the jhānas being states of “absorption” that take place while cut off from most if not all sensory input. See also [AN 9.42](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42) and respective comments. DN 16 does contain an account of both the Buddha’s and one of his former teachers’ minds being established in such a state that they did not perceive loud sounds around them. But this is referring to the formless attainments, where indeed [the mind has shed the perceptions of the five senses](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn43#mn43:10.1-mn43:10.2). ",
