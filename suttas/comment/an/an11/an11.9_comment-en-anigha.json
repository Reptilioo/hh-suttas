  "an11.9:7.1": "For each item here the locative case occurs, which often denotes simultaneity. This is the same reasoning behind my rendering of [the _satipaṭṭhāna_ stanza](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10#mn10:3.1-mn10:3.5). This doesn't mean that things disappear altogether. This would be illogical especially in the case of the last item except potentially for the cessation of perception and feeling. But it is clearly not being stated that that is the only right meditation. What it means is that the mind does not become “established” in any of these things while they are there. For a detailed treatise on what that entails, see [“The Meaning of Yoniso Manasikāra”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf). ",
  "an11.9:7.3": "See AN 4.77, in which the field of one in jhāna (_jhāyissa jhānavisayo_) is said to be impossible to ascertain. This is because _jhāna_ does not take place at the level of the _content_ of one's experience, not even, as stated here, the objects of the mental faculty (_mano_). Simply put, jhāna is the unification of the mind (_citta_) on a certain overarching attitude, purified from unwholesome inclinations, that is independent of the content of the six senses, the only constraint being that in the first jhāna there cannot be speech, in the second there can be no thinking and pondering, and so on (SN 36.11). See [“What The Jhānas Actually Are”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/what-the-jhanas-actually-are/). "
