  "an1.51:1.3": "The fundamental defilement is ignorance. Simply by not rightly \nunderstanding for himself, as it is, that no experience can ever be \nsomething other or “more” than form, feeling, perception, intention, and\n consciousness, both for _puthujjana_ and _Arahant_ alike, the former is\n subject to defilements. The defilements are “adventitious” because \nultimately they too cannot be something _apart_ from form, feeling, \nperception, intention, and consciousness,  but because that is not \nunderstood by the _puthujjana_, the defilements are there. (This is the meaning of the famous expression of the Bāhiya Sutta, “In the seen, just the seen”, which does not refer to to some sort of “bare awareness” where parts of the aggregates have been cut off—an expectation that plainly indicates the presence of the very ignorance in question). When this is \nunderstood, there is no room whatsoever for passion, aversion, or \nmuddledness of any kind (let alone the actions and misconduct that would\n result from them). [“Why Are You Not an Arahant \nYet?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xcPXgsuIsU). ",
  "an1.51:1.4": "They do not understand how to _abandon_ the aggregates as they are. Instead, they inevitably (and unwittingly) seek to manipulate them one way or another, and since ignorance underlies that entire endeavor, purity does not lie at the end of it. "
