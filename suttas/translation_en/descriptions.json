    "dn10": "The three noble aggregates taught, praised and encouraged by the Buddha: Sīla, involving good conduct by body and speech; Samādhi, encompassing sense restraint, recollection-and-awareness, contentment and jhānas; and Paññā, comprised of being endowed with knowledge-and-vision as well as various kinds of abilities, including comprehension of mind and seeing the Four Noble Truths with right understanding.",
    "mn2": "The realization of the Dhamma is for one who, having developed and understood how to attend to phenomena with yoniso manasikāra, gives up influxes in seven distinct ways.",
    "mn16": "A trainee wishing to progress on the path should do away with ten impediments so that their mind may become fertile ground for achieving maturity in the Dhamma. With this foundation, they can develop composure and zeal—the final essential factors for attaining complete liberation and freedom from suffering.",
    "mn18": "The work of overcoming one's defilements does not depend on something outside of their control; no matter the circumstances one who has developed yoniso manasikāra can strive toward equanimity by attending to the besetting perceptions “in light of their origin”; being unmoved by them one has removed the need for indulgence and denial, they have achieved the Middle Way.",
    "mn19": "Fostering the context of danger and harm of unbeneficial thoughts, while also making efforts to not think along thoughts stemming from an arisen harmful mental state–and doing so, inclining the mind in the opposite direction—is how one can bring about the “starvation” of hindrances and develop jhāna.",
    "mn22": "The actions the Buddha warned against as obstructive cannot be performed without there being a harmful mental state, the very root of suffering. The view that one can engage in such acts without impeding progress on the path to awakening is a pernicious misconception.",
    "mn24": "The path to Nibbāna progresses through successive stages of purification, each laying the foundation for the next, ultimately leading to the total cessation of assumption.",
    "mn38": "Misconceptions about dependent origination have the potential to entirely derail one's practice. It is not a temporal sequence of causes and effect but a simultaneous interdependence of two phenomena in the present experience. It's about knowing the uncontrollable underlying foundation of the current phenomenon while it is enduring so appropriation in regard to anything within it ceases.",
    "mn39": "One seeking to be a true ascetic and to realize the goal of the ascetic life must undertake the training laid down by the Buddha and progress through its various stages, never resting content with what has already been achieved.",
    "mn53": "A noble disciple fit to be called a practicing trainee has to be endowed with various qualities, all of which need to be fostered to progress in the practice.",
