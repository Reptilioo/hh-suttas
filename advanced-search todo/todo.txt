Ravamp findSearchTermPassages() and combine it with findVerseRange(), it should:

- Take textData, searchTerm, singleVerse, strict, pali, singleResult as parameters?
- Search for matches of searchTerm in textData and extract the verse range from the keys of the verse in the form "startVerse-endVerse".
- Extract passages made of the searchTerm and the text around it. 
  Passages should have 150 words maximum.
  If we get to the start or the end of the sutta, we go fetch the words after or before respectively. 
  If sutta is smaller than 150 words, returns entire sutta.
  If searchTerm is longer than 150 words and found in sutta, returns passage of searchTerm length even if longer than 150 words.
- Add ellipses "[...]" before or after the passages if there is still text before or after respectively.
- If singleVerse==true: should return only one verse in passage (used for comments).
- If strict==true: should search only for exact words (not return "training" in "restraining")
- If pali==true: should remove diacritics from textData and searchTerm for search without diacritics. But should return passages with diacritics.
- Should only index the sutta once and re-used the same data for the multiples matches in the same sutta.
